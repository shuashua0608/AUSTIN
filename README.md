# MUStroke

We use [MARLIN](https://github.com/ControlNet/MARLIN) for visual feature extraction, and pretrained VGG model from [ONE-PEACE](https://github.com/OFA-Sys/ONE-PEACE/tree/main) for audio feature extraction.

To run code for uncertainty estimation experiment: 
```
python ablate_PEACE_MAE_uncertain.py --epoch 100
```
